   2) desicion tree (Titanic - binary classification), 
   3) kaggle - weather forecasting in Australia, 
   4) kaggle - Megafon
   
2. Unsupervised learning 
   a) sensors on hands (PCA + KNeighborsClassifier),
   b) clustering of texts (standard text preprocessing + DBSCAN)
   
3. Kaggle - porn detection (text preprocessing, TfidfVectorizer, Mystem, nltk, WordNetLemmatizer, n-grams + ensemble method)

4. Language identification (text preprocessing, CountVectorizer, n-grams)

5. Book recommendation system
   a) simple personal top
   b) method based on clustering similar users
   c) co-occurrence recommendation
