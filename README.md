## Hello!
### There is homework for the "Fundamentals of machine learning" from Mail.ru Group
1. 1) Linear model (theory), 
   2) desicion tree (Titanic - binary classification), 
   3) kaggle - weather forecasting in Australia, 
   4) kaggle - Megafon
   
2. Unsupervised learning 
   1) sensors on hands (PCA + KNeighborsClassifier),
   2) clustering of texts (standard text preprocessing + DBSCAN)
   
3. Kaggle - porn detection (text preprocessing, TfidfVectorizer, Mystem, nltk, WordNetLemmatizer, n-grams + ensemble method)

4. Language identification (text preprocessing, CountVectorizer, n-grams)

5. Book recommendation system
   1) simple personal top
   2) method based on clustering similar users
   3) co-occurrence recommendation
   4) content based
   5) collaborative filtering
   6) matrix factorization
   
6. Geodata (GeoPandas, OSM, Overpass API, Folium)

7. A/B testing (Shapiro-Wilk test, Fligner-Killing test, t-test, ATE, CUPED, ANCOVA, Difference in differences, CATE, uplift)

8. Spark (database basics)
